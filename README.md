# TickScan
Tickscan uses state-of-the-art object detection algorithms for the recognition of different tick species belonging to the Hyalomma genus. Ticks of this genus are amongst the most frequent ectoparasites of livestock in the NENA region, they transmit several pathogens of veterinary and human importance. Tickscan has been trained to recognize two important Hyalomma species in Tunisia, Hyalomma dromedarii which has been recently shown to carry the Crimeanâ€“Congo hemorrhagic fever virus in Southern Tunisia, and H. scupense which is the vector of T. annulata the agent of tropical theileriosis an important disease of cattle in the NENA region.
Tickscan may help better mitigate tick threats through early detection of population dynamic shifts, 
YOLOv5 model achieved the best detection performance in both tick sexes with an approximate precision (AP) of 0.76 followed by Faster RCNN (AP= 0.69) and SSD (AP=0.49), while DERT and Effcient Det models had the poorest metrics (AP= 0.48 and 0.42), correspendangly.
